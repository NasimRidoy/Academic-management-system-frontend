vscode setup:
autosave turned on


onMounted() is a lifecycle hook
runs after the current component is created and rendered.
as data should be loaded after the component mounts not before.


.value inside script
no need of .value inside template

steps:
created DepartmentView
installed vue-router
created index.js inside router
created the departments route and exported the router
app.use(router) inside the main.js to register the router
RouterView inside the App.vue

created DepartmentDetailsView
need useRoute to get the id
find the object from the json data with the same id
and assign the object to the reactive state by .value
use v-if v-else for corner case

as this view will loaded from the DepartmentView
in that apply useRouter to push the dynamic path to the url


v-if is must for rendering data that is fetched from api.
bcz the execution flow:
script runs
state variable initially null
template renders
onMounted runs
than the html get the data

so template renders before onMounted, so it tries to access property of null state value
which gives runtime error.
